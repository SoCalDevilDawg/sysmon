A basic system monitoring utility. Requires no extra permissions. Steady 0% CPU usage is its current best feature.

Requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later.

Tested only on Windows 7 (64bit).

### Rationale

Other system monitors are either too heavy, include lots of things that don't tell me anything useful, or simply are unstable and annoying.
This one is geared towards telling what part of the hardware (CPU, memory, or NVM) is the biggest problem.

No GPU monitoring currently, since there's nothing built-in to the Windows OS nor .NET to do so.

### Problems

Bulky design.
Missing some vital monitoring elements.
Barely any configuration potential.
